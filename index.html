            <h2>A Special Message 💌</h2>
            <p>
                Dear Priyanshi,  <br>
                HAPPY BIRTHDAY ❤️ <br>
                You always said what I wanted to hear, you always gave me hope. There was a time I lost faith in the world, thinking it’s filled with selfish relationships and people. But then I found you, a real meant-to-be bestie, the most selfless person I know after my mom. Yeah, you read it right! I really wish we could meet in person, and this friendship will last long until I die. You’re the most sweet, kind, selfless friend I could ever get.<br>
              
                I always fail to control my emotions and words when I speak with others, but with you, I don’t need to worry about it because there are no judgments. Even if you're thousands of kilometers away from me, I don’t feel we have any distance between us. <br>Just like Injeolmi says:  
                "우리 사이에는 거리가 없어. 그래서 조절할 필요도 없지." <br> 
              
                I just want to tell you, no matter what life throws at us, we both will never give up. Kindness and hard work always win over toxicity, and I know you’re trying your best. But remember, there is always someone out there rooting for you, and I am on number 1! Haha! I wish I could vanish all your worries out of your mind. I will come to meet you someday, just like I always say..~  
                Once again, I wish you a really very  
              
                HAPPY BIRTHDAY & WELCOME TO ADULTHOOD!  
                Many more amazing things are waiting ahead for you! <br>
              
                With love,  
                Himani...
